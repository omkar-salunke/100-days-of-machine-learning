  description: In this lab, you secure Unity Catalog objects in Azure Databricks by granting fine-grained access control to a Databricks group, applying row filters to restrict customer data by region, and masking PII email addresses using column mask functions. You also create an Azure Key Vault-backed secret scope and retrieve secrets securely inside a notebook, so sensitive credentials are never exposed in code.

# Lab 04: Secure Unity Catalog Objects

## Scenario

You are a data engineer at **NorthMart Retail**, a national supermarket chain operating across four regions: North, South, East, and West. Your team manages a centralized data platform in Azure Databricks, containing customer data, loyalty programme records, and regional sales transactions.

The security team has raised several concerns:

- Regional analysts should only see data for their own region — not other regions' customer records.
- Customer email addresses are personally identifiable information (PII) and must be masked for most users.
- A third-party loyalty platform requires an API key to integrate — that key must never be stored in notebooks or code.

In this lab, you address all three concerns by implementing **access control**, **row filtering**, **column masking**, and **Azure Key Vault-backed secrets** in Azure Databricks Unity Catalog.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will have:

- Granted and verified schema-level permissions to a Databricks group using SQL.
- Applied a row filter function to restrict customer records by region.
- Applied a column mask to protect PII email data.
- Created an Azure Key Vault and stored a secret.
- Created a Key Vault-backed secret scope in Azure Databricks.
- Retrieved a secret securely inside a notebook.

This lab should take approximately **35–40 minutes** to complete.

## 🤖 Use Genie Code throughout this lab

You are **expected and encouraged** to use the **Genie Code** at all times during this lab. Every exercise cell in the notebook includes a suggested prompt you can paste directly into Genie Code panel.

To open Genie Code, select the ![assistant-icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP-750T00-Implement-Data-Engineering-Solutions-using-Azure-Databricks/refs/heads/main/Allfiles/media/genie-code.svg) on the right side of any notebook cell, or press the keyboard shortcut shown in the toolbar.

> 💡 **Tip:** Do not just copy and paste Genie Code's output blindly. Read it, understand it, and adapt it to the task requirements. Genie Code is a tool to accelerate your thinking, not replace it.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have:

- An **Azure Databricks Premium workspace** provisioned using [Lab 00: Set up your Azure Databricks environment](00-setup.md).
- An active **Unity Catalog metastore** attached to the workspace.
- The **CREATE CATALOG** privilege on the metastore.
- An **Azure subscription** where you can create a Key Vault.
- Familiarity with basic SQL (CREATE TABLE, SELECT, GRANT).

## Import the lab notebook

1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, select **Workspace** in the left sidebar.
2. Navigate to or create a folder where you want to store this lab.
3. Select the **⋮** (kebab) menu next to the folder, then select **Import**.
4. Choose **URL**, enter the following URL, and select **Import**:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP-750T00-Implement-Data-Engineering-Solutions-using-Azure-Databricks/refs/heads/main/Allfiles/04-secure-unity-catalog-objects.ipynb`
5. Open the imported notebook and, in the compute selector at the top, choose **Serverless** compute.

## Before you open the notebook: Create a Databricks group

You will grant permissions to a Databricks group in Exercise 1. Create the group now so it is ready when you reach that exercise.

1. In the Databricks workspace, select **your username** (top right) → **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Identity and access** → **Groups** → select **Manage** → **Add group**.
3. Name the group `retail-analysts` and select **Save**.
4. Once the group is created, add your own user account as a member.

> ℹ️ This group represents the regional analyst team at NorthMart Retail. You will grant it access to the lab schema in Exercise 1.

## Before Exercise 4: Create an Azure Key Vault

Exercise 4 requires an Azure Key Vault with a pre-created secret. Complete these steps in the Azure Portal before reaching Exercise 4 in the notebook, or prepare them in parallel.

### Step 1: Create the Key Vault

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Create a resource**.
2. Search for **Key Vault** and select **Create**.
3. Configure the Key Vault:
   - **Resource group**: use your lab resource group.
   - **Key vault name**: `kv-northmart-<your-initials>` (must be globally unique).
   - **Region**: the same region as your Databricks workspace.
   - **Pricing tier**: Standard.
4. On the **Access configuration** tab, set the **Permission model** to **Vault access policy**.
5. Select **Review + create**, then **Create**.

### Step 2: Add an access policy for your user

1. Once the Key Vault is deployed, open it in the portal.
2. Select **Access policies** → **Create**.
3. Under **Secret permissions**, select **Get** and **List**.
4. Under **Principal**, search for and select your own Azure user account.
5. Select **Create** to save the policy.

### Step 3: Add a secret

1. In the Key Vault, select **Secrets** → **Generate/Import**.
2. Set the following:
   - **Name**: `loyalty-api-key`
   - **Value**: `NORTHMART-LOYALTY-2026-SECURE`
3. Select **Create**.

### Step 4: Note down the Key Vault details

Before leaving the Key Vault, navigate to **Properties** and copy:
- **Vault URI** (DNS Name), for example: *https://kv-northmart-abc.vault.azure.net/*
- **Resource ID**, for example: */subscriptions/xxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/rg-lab/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/kv-northmart-abc*

You will need both values when creating the Databricks secret scope in Exercise 4.

### Step 5: Create a Databricks secret scope

1. In your browser, navigate to:

    ```
    https://<your-databricks-workspace-url>#secrets/createScope
    ```

    > ⚠️ The **S** in **createScope** must be uppercase. Replace `<your-databricks-workspace-url>` with your actual workspace URL (omit any trailing '/').

2. Configure the scope:
   - **Scope Name**: `retail-kv-scope`
   - **Manage Principal**: `All workspace users`
   - **DNS Name**: paste the Vault URI from Step 4.
   - **Resource ID**: paste the Resource ID from Step 4.
3. Select **Create**.

> ✅ **Expected result:** You should see a confirmation message that the scope was created. The scope is now linked to your Azure Key Vault, and any secrets you add there are accessible from Databricks notebooks.

You are now ready to open the notebook and complete the exercises.
