# Set up your Azure Databricks environment

Before starting the labs in this course, you need to provision an **Azure Databricks Premium workspace**. This setup lab walks you through that process using **Azure Cloud Shell** so you don't need to install any tools locally.

This setup should take approximately **15 minutes** to complete.

---

## Provision an Azure Databricks Premium workspace

You'll use a single Azure CLI script in Cloud Shell to create a resource group and an Azure Databricks Premium workspace in a randomly selected Azure region.

### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com` using the credentials provided to you.

2. Select the **Cloud Shell** button (**>_**) in the toolbar at the top of the portal. If prompted, select **Bash** as the shell type.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the Cloud Shell button isn't visible, your browser window may be too narrow. Try expanding the window or navigating directly to `https://shell.azure.com` to open Cloud Shell in a full browser tab.
    >

3. If this is your first time using Cloud Shell, you're prompted to set up a storage account. Select **No storage account required**, choose your subscription, and select **Apply**.

4. Wait for the Cloud Shell prompt to appear. It looks like this:

    ```
    yourname@Azure:~$
    ```

### Task 2: Run the provisioning script

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to download and execute the setup script:

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP-750T00-Implement-Data-Engineering-Solutions-using-Azure-Databricks/refs/heads/main/Instructions/Labs/00-setup.sh | bash
    ```

2. Wait for the deployment to finish. This takes approximately **5 minutes**. 

> [!NOTE]
> The region is chosen at random from a list of supported public Azure regions. The workspace name and resource group name are fixed so you can easily find them in later labs.

### Task 3: Open the Azure Databricks workspace

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Azure Databricks** in the top search bar and select it.

2. Select the **adb-dp750** workspace from the list.

3. On the workspace overview page, select **Launch workspace**. The Azure Databricks UI opens in a new browser tab.

4. Confirm you can see the Azure Databricks home page. You are now ready to start the course labs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep the **rg-dp750** resource group name noted. You'll need it if you want to clean up resources after the course.
