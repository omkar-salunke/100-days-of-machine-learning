# Lab 12: Implement Development Lifecycle Processes in Azure Databricks

## Introduction

You are a data engineer responsible for maintaining an **order processing pipeline** used by your warehouse operations team. The pipeline reads raw order data, removes invalid records, normalizes status codes, and computes tax-inclusive totals.

As the pipeline moves toward production, your team has decided to adopt proper **software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices**. That means:

- Implementing a **testing strategy** so bugs are caught before deployment
- Packaging the pipeline as a **Declarative Automation Bundle (DAB)** so it can be deployed consistently across environments
- Using the **Databricks CLI** to validate, preview, and deploy the bundle

This lab is structured in three parts:

| Part | Topic | Where |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Part 1** | Implement unit tests with pytest | Notebook |
| **Part 2** | Configure a Declarative Automation Bundle | Workspace terminal |
| **Part 3** | Deploy and verify the bundle with the Databricks CLI | Workspace terminal |

## 🤖 Use Genie Code throughout this lab

You are expected and **encouraged** to use the **Genie Code** for every exercise. 

To open Genie Code, select the ![assistant-icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP-750T00-Implement-Data-Engineering-Solutions-using-Azure-Databricks/refs/heads/main/Allfiles/media/genie-code.svg) on the right side of any notebook cell, or use the keyboard shortcut.

Use it to:
- Generate pytest fixtures and test functions
- Understand error messages and fix failing tests
- Draft YAML bundle configuration
- Look up CLI command syntax

---

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure Databricks Premium workspace** provisioned using [Lab 00: Set up your Azure Databricks environment](00-setup.md).
- You have permission to create jobs in the workspace (required for Part 3).
- Basic familiarity with Python and pytest.

---

## Part 1: Implement a Testing Strategy (Notebook)

### Import the notebook

1. In your Databricks workspace, click **Workspace** in the left sidebar.
2. Navigate to or create a folder where you want to store the lab.
3. Click the **⋮** (kebab menu) or right-click the folder, then select **Import**.
4. Choose **URL**, enter the following URL, and click **Import**:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP-750T00-Implement-Data-Engineering-Solutions-using-Azure-Databricks/refs/heads/main/Allfiles/12-implement-development-lifecycle-processes-in-azure-databricks.ipynb`
5. Open the imported notebook and, in the compute selector at the top, choose **Serverless** compute.

### Work through the notebook

The notebook contains three exercises:

- **Exercise 1** — Install pytest and review the provided **transforms.py** module that you will test.
- **Exercise 2** — Write unit tests for each transformation function using pytest fixtures.
- **Exercise 3** — Write an integration test that runs the full pipeline against data created with a Spark session.

Complete all exercises before continuing to Part 2.

## Part 2: Configure a Declarative Automation Bundle

Declarative Automation Bundles (DABs) let you define your Databricks resources — jobs, pipelines, notebooks — as **infrastructure-as-code** in YAML configuration files. This makes deployments repeatable and auditable.

In this part, you create a bundle for the order processing job using the **Databricks CLI** on your local machine.

### Install and configure the Databricks CLI

1. Install the Databricks CLI using PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   winget install Databricks.DatabricksCLI
   ```

   Verify the installation:

   ```powershell
   databricks --version
   ```

2. Authenticate the CLI against your Azure Databricks workspace:

   ```powershell
   databricks auth login --host https://<your-workspace-url>
   ```

   Replace **<your-workspace-url>** with the URL of your workspace (for example, https://adb-1234567890123456.7.azuredatabricks.net). Follow the browser prompts to complete authentication.

3. Create a new project directory and navigate into it:

   ```powershell
   mkdir ~/order-pipeline-bundle; cd ~/order-pipeline-bundle
   mkdir notebooks, resources
   ```

### Create the bundle configuration file

Your task is to create a databricks.yml file with the following requirements:

- Bundle name: `order-pipeline-bundle`
- A variables section with:
  - An environment variable (default: `development`)
  - A cluster_policy_id variable with a description and no default value
- A resources section defining a job named order-pipeline-job that:
  - Has a display name using the environment variable: ${var.environment}-order-pipeline
  - Has two notebook tasks:
    - validate-data — runs ./notebooks/validate.py
    - transform-data — depends on validate-data and runs ./notebooks/transform.py
- A targets section with:
  - A dev target (default, development mode, environment = development)
  - A prod target (production mode, with its own workspace host and environment = production)

Use the PowerShell snippet below as a **starting point** and fill in the sections marked with `# TODO`:

```powershell
@'
bundle:
  name: order-pipeline-bundle

variables:
  environment:
    description: The deployment environment name
    default: development
  # TODO: Add a variable named 'cluster_policy_id'
  # It should have a description and no default value.

resources:
  jobs:
    order-pipeline-job:
      name: ${var.environment}-order-pipeline
      tasks:
        - task_key: validate-data
          notebook_task:
            notebook_path: ./notebooks/validate.py
        # TODO: Add a second task named 'transform-data'
        # It should depend on 'validate-data' and run ./notebooks/transform.py
        # Refer to the 'depends_on' key in the Declarative Automation Bundle schema.

targets:
  dev:
    default: true
    mode: development
    variables:
      environment: development
  # TODO: Add a 'prod' target that:
  # - sets mode to production
  # - sets a workspace host (use a placeholder URL for now)
  # - overrides the environment variable to 'production'
'@ | Set-Content databricks.yml
```

> 🤖 **Genie Code tip:** Ask *"Show me a complete Declarative Automation Bundle databricks.yml example with two targets, job tasks, and custom variables"* to get a full reference configuration you can adapt.

### Create placeholder notebooks (required for validation)

Bundle validation checks that referenced notebooks exist. Create two placeholder notebook files:

```powershell
"# validate" | Set-Content notebooks/validate.py
"# transform" | Set-Content notebooks/transform.py
```

---

## Part 3: Deploy and Verify the Bundle with the Databricks CLI

With your bundle configured, you use the **Databricks CLI** to validate, preview, and deploy it to your workspace.

### Step 1 — Validate the bundle

Run the following command from inside the order-pipeline-bundle directory. This checks that your databricks.yml is syntactically correct and references valid resources.

```powershell
databricks bundle validate
```

If validation succeeds, you will see a summary showing the bundle name, target environment, and workspace path. If there are errors, review the output and fix the YAML before continuing.

> 🤖 **Tip:** Copy any validation error messages and paste them into Genie Code to get an explanation and suggested fix.

### Step 2 — Preview the deployment plan

Before making any changes to your workspace, preview what the deployment would create or update:

```powershell
databricks bundle plan
```

Review the output. You should see that the order-pipeline-job would be **created** (since it doesn't exist yet). For a non-default target, specify it explicitly:

```powershell
databricks bundle plan -t dev
```

### Step 3 — Deploy the bundle

Deploy the bundle to the `dev` target:

```powershell
databricks bundle deploy -t dev
```

During deployment, the CLI:
- Uploads your notebook files to the workspace
- Creates the order-pipeline-job in the **Jobs & Pipelines** section of your workspace (prefixed with `[dev <username>]` because development mode is active)

### Step 4 — Verify the deployed resources

Confirm the deployment succeeded:

```powershell
databricks bundle summary
```

The output includes direct URLs to the created job. Open the URL in your browser to verify that the job appears in your workspace with both tasks (validate-data and transform-data) correctly configured.

> 🤖 **Tip:** Ask *"What does Declarative Automation Bundle development mode do to job names and schedules?"* to understand why the job is prefixed with your username.

### Step 5 — Clean up (optional)

To remove the deployed resources from your workspace:

```powershell
databricks bundle destroy -t dev
```

Confirm when prompted to delete the job that was created.
